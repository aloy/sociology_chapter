The materials in this document supplement the information presented in the manuscript 
``Better Diagnostics for Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using Visual Inference.'' Section~\ref{sec:datasets} describes the data sets used to illustrate the use of visual inference in the paper.
Section~\ref{study} describes the experimental setup, the calculation of $p$-values, and additional lineups that were included in the study, but omitted from the paper for brevity. The figure numbering carries on from the paper for ease of reporting results.

\section{Data sets}\label{sec:datasets}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the data sets used in this paper are publicly available: the General Certificate of Secondary Education Exam data set is available in the R package mlmRev \citep{mlmRev}; the Dialyzer data set is available in the R package MEMSS \citep{MEMSS}; all other data sets can be found in the R package HLMdiag \citep{HLMDiag}.

\subsection{General certificate of secondary education exam data}\label{data:GCSE}

We make use of a subset of examination results of 4,065 students nested within 65 inner-London schools discussed by \cite{Goldstein:1993wm}. The original analysis explored school effectiveness as defined by students' performance on the General Certificate of Secondary Education Exam (GCSEE) in both mathematics and English. This exam is taken at the end of compulsory education, typically when students are 16 years old.  To adjust for a student's ability when they began secondary education, the students' scores on the standardized London Reading Test (LRT) and verbal reasoning group (bottom 25\%, middle 50\%, or top 25\%) at age 11 were recorded. Additional information contained in the data set includes student gender, school gender, and the average LRT intake score for each school. 


\subsection{Autism study}\label{data:autism}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\alnote{I need to pare this down.}
%Autism is a developmental disorder typically characterized by impaired communication and social skills, but there is relatively little consensus on how these abilities or disabilities change over time \citep{Anderson:2007cl, Anderson:2009in}. 
In an effort to better understand changes in verbal and social abilities from childhood to adolescence, \cite{Anderson:2007cl, Anderson:2009in} carried out a prospective longitudinal study following 214 children between the ages of 2 and 13 who had been diagnosed with either autism spectrum disorder or non-spectrum developmental delays at age 2. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Interview survey was used to assess each child's interpersonal relationships, play time activities, and coping skills, 
%This survey is completed by the parents. 
from which the Vineland Socialization Age Equivalent (VSAE) was computed as an overall measure of a child's social skills. Additionally, expressive language development at age 2 was assessed using the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) and the children were classified into three groups (high, medium, or low). Assessments were made on the children at ages 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13, however, not all children were assessed at each age. Additional information collected on each child includes: gender, race (white or non-white), and initial diagnosis at age 2 (autism, pervasive development disorder (pdd), or non-spectrum). We restricted attention to models concerned with the changes in social skills for subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder having complete data. This results in a reduced data set of 155 children. For more detailed analyses we refer the reader to \cite{Anderson:2007cl, Anderson:2009in}.

\subsection{Methylprednisolone study}\label{data:ahd}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\cite{Carithers:1989} conducted a four week longitudinal study to investigate the effectiveness of methylprednisolone to treat patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The researchers randomly assigned 66 patients to receive either methylprednisolone (35 patients) or a placebo (31 patients). Over the study duration, each subject's serum bilirubin levels (in $\mu$mol/L) were measured each week, with the first measurement taken at the start of the study (week 0).

\subsection{Dialyzer study}\label{data:dialyzer}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\cite{Vonesh:1992us} describe a study characterizing the water transportation characteristics of 20 high flux membrane dialyzers, which were introduced to reduce the time a patient spends on hemodialysis. The 20 dialyzers were studied \emph{in vitro} using bovine blood at flow rates of either 200 or 300 ml/min, and the ultrafiltration rate (ml/hr) for each dialyzer was measured at seven transmembrane pressures (in mmHg). \cite{Vonesh:1992us} use nonlinear mixed-effects models to analyze these data; however, they can be modeled using polynomials in the linear mixed-effects framework \citep[see][Section 9.5]{Littell:2006}.

\subsection{Radon study}\label{data:radon}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data consist of a stratified random sample of 919 owner-occupied homes in 85 counties in Minnesota. For each home, a radon measurement was recorded (in log $pCi/L$, i.e., log picoCuries per liter) as well as a binary variable indicating whether the measurement was taken in the basement (0) or a higher level (1). Additionally, the average soil uranium content for each county was available. The number of homes within each county varies greatly between counties ranging from one home to 116 homes, with 50\% of counties having measurements from between 3 and 10 homes. \cite{Gelman:2006ue} suggest a simple hierarchical model allowing for a random intercept for each county and a random slope for floor level. This is the model from which we simulate predicted random effects.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Experimental Setup and Results}\label{study}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Experimental Setup and Calculation of $p$-values}\label{sec:pvalues}
For each of the lineup designs described in the paper we constructed five replicates consisting of the same data plot and different sets of nineteen null plots for a total of 75 different lineups. These were evaluated by 487 participants in altogether 4927 evaluations. For each lineup, observers were instructed to identify the plot  most different from the set and asked what feature led them to their choice. 
These choices came in the form of four suggestions (in checkboxes) and one text box for a free-form answer. For each lineup the time taken to answer was recorded and  observers were asked for their confidence level (on a scale from 1=weak to 5=high). Observers were also asked to provide their demographics: age category, gender,  education range, and geographic location (from parts of the ip address). 

The results of the evaluations for all lineups  are displayed in Table~\ref{tab:results} and the observers' reasons for identifying plots are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:reasons}. 
The significances in Table~\ref{tab:results} are based on the number of evaluations and the number of times that the data plot was identified. For that, we the introduce the random variable $Y$ as the  number of evaluations of a lineup in which the observer identifies the data plot. Assume that the lineup has size $m=20$, and it is shown to a total of $K$ independent observers.  Then $Y$ has a Visual distribution $V_{K, m, s=3}$ as defined in \citet{hofmann:2015},
where $s$ delineates scenario III---i.e., the same lineup is shown to all $K$ observers. The $p$-values in Table~\ref{tab:results} for each of the five replicates are calculated this way.
For the overall $p$-value, we use a simulation based approach to combine the five results. Treating the number of evaluations $(K_1, ..., K_5)$ as fixed, we simulate assessments of lineups without signal as follows: we assume that the signal in a plot is complementary to its $p$-value, which is i.i.d. $U[0,1]$ under the null hypothesis. We further assume that the probability an observer picks a  plot  is allocated proportionally to its signal. For each ``data plot'' we create five sets of null plots to be evaluated simultaneously $(K_1, ..., K_5)$ times.  
$p$-values are then based on a comparison of the sum of data picks from  five no-signal lineups and  the observed number of data picks from the actual lineups. The column on the right of Table~\ref{tab:results} shows $p$-values based on $10^5$ simulation runs.


%How did we get the data? Some information on Amazon Turk, and setup of experiments. 

%\hhnote{Data collected for each response: time taken, answer(s), confidence level and reason for choice - four suggestions in form of check boxes, one text box;
%data collected on each participant: gender, age group, education level, geography (from ip address), nickname to match responses from the same individual. }


%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Discussion of study results} % and participants' demographics}
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%%All of the lineups discussed in this paper (and the two presented in Appendix~\ref{app:morelineups}) were evaluated using Amazon MTurk. All  lineups were evaluated in the same study, which we describe below.
%
%%For each of the ten lineups, five replications were constructed for a total of 50 lineups. The replications for the lineup in Figure~\ref{fig:qqlineup-t} were created by different simulations, while the replications for the remaining lineups were created by shuffling the location of the true plot and exchanging the null plots for additional simulations under the null model. For each lineup, observers were instructed to identify the plot that is most different and asked what feature led them to their choice. Overall the study was comprised of  334 participants who made 3441 evaluations. 
%
%The results show that for all but the Q-Q plots of the random slopes, enough observers identified the true plot so that we reject the null hypotheses that the data are consistent with what is expected under the null model. For the Q-Q plot of the random slopes generated by a $t$ distribution, three of the five replicates resulted in a rejection of the null hypothesis of normality. The variability in the results is explained by different ``true'' plots being simulated for each replicate. 



%\hhnote{I'm not sure how much more detail we can give here - we're in the process of writing up the exact distribution, but the vinference package on my github site already allows for a calculation of the corrected $p$-values.}
%\alnote{Can we cite the R package? Having a citation might help with this.}
%
%\hhnote{Only three out of five replicates are providing significant results against the null hypothesis.}
%
%\hhnote{Explain how we deal with five $p$-values from five lineups with the same data and different null sets }


%\hh{There are five different null sets for each data set. Throughout the paper we show lineups for the first replicate. In all of the lineups with the exception of figure~\ref{fig:qqlineup-1} observers are identifying the data plot to a degree that we have to reject the null hypotheses of the data being consistent with the null model. }
%\hh{For the radon t ranef example we have actually five different samples from a $t$ distribution in the lineups - that explains the much larger variability between the results. }

\subsection{Additional lineups included in the study}\label{app:morelineups}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section includes two lineups that were included in the  MTurk study, but were not discussed in the paper. 

Figure~\ref{fig:constvar2.bp} contains a box plot representation of the same data as Figure~5 in the paper, but categorizes pressure into seven categories, and shows residuals in the form of box plots. In order to preserve the appearance of continuity on the $x$-axis we used a color scheme to fill the boxes with deepening shades of blue from left to right. In this form 23 out of 70 observers identify the plot of the data.  This is consistent with the other design.

%\hhnote{reference to corresponding lineup in main paper}
Figure~\ref{fig:autism-ranef} displays another lineup testing the adequacy of the random effects specification  (see Section~3.2 of the paper) using data from the autism study. The null plots were generated from a model containing only a linear random slope, so if the true plot in panel \#($\sqrt{16} + 12$) is identified it provides support for the inadequacy of this specification, and the need for additional random effects. %Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot-unordered} shows similar data  as Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot-ordered}, where categories were re-labelled to investigate whether the order might have an effect on people's choices. Interestingly, the power is the same, and observers still identify 'trend' as one of the top reason for their choice.

%\alnote{Figures~\ref{homogeneous-1} and~\ref{homogeneous-2} are really no different from the cyclone plots, aside from showing two different designs. I am not sure whether they add anything to the discussion in this section. To me they seem to detract from the cyclone plot discussion. One idea is to move them to the appendix where we can highlight the difference in designs. I don't think moving this would detract from how ``novel'' our contribution is.}

Figures~\ref{homogeneous-1} and~\ref{homogeneous-2} show another example of testing for homogeneity in the variance following the approach taken in Section~4.1 of the paper. Both of these lineups are based on the dialyzer data. 
%\alnote{I am confused by plots 7 and 8. What data set are they displaying?}
Level-1 residuals are plotted by subject. Subjects are ordered by variance---i.e.,~we get some structure that might be taken for differences in variability, that are really just differences due to the imbalance in group size. If any panel of this lineup is considered separately, an analyst may come to the conclusion that the within-group variance increases across the $x$ axis.  However, inserting the true plot into the lineup forces the analyst to consider this particular feature as inherent to the data structure rather than evidence against a hypothesis of homogenous variance. 
The dot plot version is not significant, but the box plot version is. When participants in the box plot design identify the data plot, about 45.3\% give outliers as the reason for their choice. In contrast to that, outliers, a large spread or a trend are in a three-way tie for the reason for identifying the data plot in the lineup with the dot plot design.

The reason for the box plot design being so much more significant might not be so much of an issue of homogeneity being violated as much as a difference in the error distribution between the data and the nulls. Null data come from a parametric bootstrap where residuals are simulated under a normal error assumption. Outliers in small samples are indicative of the sample being from a distribution with heavy tails.
Regardless of the reasoning, the second lineup design enables us to diagnose a problem with the model that makes the data stand out from a set of nulls.  The two designs therefore represent two very similar tests with different power.
